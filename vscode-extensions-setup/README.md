## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **VSCode must be installed** on your system
2. **VSCode CLI must be available** in your PATH
   - Open VSCode
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
   - Type "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
   - Select and execute the command

### Installation

Run the installation script:

```bash
# Navigate to the setup directory
cd vscode-extensions-setup

# Run the installation script
./install-extensions.sh
```

### Alternative Installation

If you prefer to run it directly from the repository root:

```bash
./vscode-extensions-setup/install-extensions.sh
```

## What the Script Does

1. **Validates Prerequisites** - Checks if VSCode CLI is available
2. **Organizes Installation** - Groups extensions by category for clarity
3. **Error Handling** - Reports success/failure for each extension
4. **Progress Tracking** - Shows installation progress with emojis and descriptions
5. **Summary Report** - Provides completion summary and next steps

## After Installation

### Immediate Steps
1. **Restart VSCode** to ensure all extensions load properly
2. **Configure GitHub Copilot** if you have access to it
3. **Select your preferred theme** from the installed options
4. **Choose your icon theme** (Material Icon Theme or vscode-icons)

### Recommended Configuration
1. **Review language-specific settings** for your primary development languages
2. **Configure Prettier** formatting rules for your projects
3. **Set up ESLint** rules if working with JavaScript/TypeScript
4. **Customize keyboard shortcuts** for installed productivity extensions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"command not found: code"**
- Solution: Install VSCode CLI as described in Prerequisites

**Extension installation fails**
- Solution: Check internet connection and try running the script again
- Individual extensions can be installed manually if needed

**Extensions not appearing**
- Solution: Restart VSCode completely

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install extensions manually, you can use:

```bash
code --install-extension <extension-id>
```

All extension IDs are clearly listed in the script for reference.

## Customization

The script can be easily customized by:
1. **Adding new extensions** - Add new `install_extension` calls
2. **Removing unwanted extensions** - Comment out or remove specific lines
3. **Organizing differently** - Rearrange the installation order
